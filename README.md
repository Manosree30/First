## Spotify Songs Analysis Project
This project explores a large Spotify songs dataset to analyze various music features using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It is designed to help beginners learn how to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on music data.

## Repo Structure
spotify_songs_analysis/
  ├─ Spotify_Project.ipynb     # Main notebook with data loading, cleaning, and analysis
  ├─ contentgenresv2.csv       # Spotify songs dataset with audio features & metadata
  ├─ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies for the project
  └─ README.md                 # This file

## Prerequisites
Python 3.9+ recommended
Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Setup Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine.

## Create a virtual environment :


python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
source .venv/bin/activate    # On macOS/Linux

## Install dependencies:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Launching the Notebook
Make sure Jupyter is installed:


pip install jupyter
Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Open Spotify_Project.ipynb and run the cells sequentially.

## What This Notebook Does

Loads over 42,000 Spotify songs with features like danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and genre.
Cleans and preprocesses the data by dropping irrelevant columns and handling missing values.
Performs summary statistics and visualizes distributions for key audio attributes.
Groups and compares songs by genre, exploring differences in musical properties.
Conducts feature engineering to create meaningful insights from raw data.
Uses Python libraries such as pandas for data handling and seaborn/matplotlib for visualization.

## Highlights and Insights
Dataset includes 14 main audio features describing song attributes.
Explores feature distributions such as danceability scores and loudness levels.
Investigates music genres including techno, hardstyle, dark trap, and more.
Visualizes trends with histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.
Provides a strong foundation for beginners to practice real-world data analysis.

## Tips for Beginners
Restart and run all cells for a clean execution and visualization results.
Each step is commented for easy understanding of data operations and transformations.
Update requirements.txt if additional packages are used.
